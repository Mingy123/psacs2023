This project contains an LNN, accessed by a Flask server, which serves the Vue frontend.  

To run the app from this source code:
1. Start a terminal and go to backend/ to install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make sure a recent version of Python 3 is used.
2. Start the backend server using `python app.py`.
2. Start a new terminal, go to frontend/ and follow the insructions there, namely `npm install` and `npm dev run`.
3. Access the link outputted by the Vue server (from frontend/) and viola!
